Allows the user to categorize their notes using folders. Folders can hold pages and/or more folders, and they can be nested to any depth.

Uses TypeScript and React for functionality, TailwindCSS for styling, and Object Oriented Programming patterns to keep track of the tree structure of the user's notes.
