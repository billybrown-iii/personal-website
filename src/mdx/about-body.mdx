### <u>Professional / Software background</u>

In 2019, I started a position as a Rule Developer at Transcepta LLC. This is an early-career tech role that involves programming in vbScript, Regular Expressions, and SQL, as well as some JavaScript and AutoHotKey.

While working there, I got hooked on the enjoyment of solving problems through code. I became interested in modern web development, and learned it my free time during the course of 2020 and 2021.

During this time, I also developed some new skills within my current position. I became the training coach for new hires in my team, wrote internal documentation, and created scripts that sped up our shared workflows.

In 2022 my learning has picked up a great deal of momentum, and I am currently committed to becoming a better engineer in the modern JavaScript development ecosystem.
