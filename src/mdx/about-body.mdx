<ExpandCollapse title="Professional / Software background">

In 2019, I began my IT career as an Automation Engineer at Transcepta LLC. This entry-level role allowed me to develop foundational skills in coding and automation. During my three years there, I dedicated free time to learning web development, earning certifications, building projects, and connecting with the local developer community.

These efforts culminated in my transition to RF-SMART in 2022 as a Software Developer I on their NetSuite Products team. This role represented a significant increase in responsibilities and challenges, involving a higher level of team engagement, stricter software standards, and greater domain complexity. I thrived in this problem-solving environment, which led to my promotion to Software Developer II in January 2024.

I am eager to continue my professional growth, with aspirations to become a Senior Developer and eventually a Software Architect.
