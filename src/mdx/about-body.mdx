<ExpandCollapse title="Professional / Software background">

In 2019, I began my IT career as a Software Developer at Transcepta LLC. This entry-level role allowed me to develop foundational skills in coding and working in a collaborative IT environment. 

During my three years at Transcepta, I dedicated free time to learning modern web development technologies, earning certifications, building projects, and connecting with the local developer community.  These efforts culminated in my transition to RF-SMART in 2022 as a Software Engineer I on their NetSuite Products team. This role was a large increase in responsibilities and challenges, involving a higher level of team engagement, stricter software standards, and greater domain complexity. I thrived in this problem-solving environment, which led to my promotion to Software Engineer II in January 2024.

I am eager to continue my professional growth, with aspirations to become a Senior Engineer and eventually a Software Architect.
