<ExpandCollapse title="Professional / Software background">

In 2019, I started a career in IT.  I was an Automation Engineer at Transcepta LLC from 2019 to 2022.  

This was a position that involved some coding, but it was entry-level, and only required moderate computer skills and willingness to learn.

During my tenure there, I learned web development in my free time.  I earned certifications, built projects, and connected with the local developer community, which eventually led to me landing a position at RF-SMART in 2022 as a Software Developer I on their NetSuite Products team.

In terms of responsibilities and challenge, this was a big step up.  But I thrived in this problem-solving environment, and was promoted to Software Developer II in January of 2024!

I am excited to maintain this trajectory, and my next goals are to become a Sr. Dev and/or a Software Architect.
