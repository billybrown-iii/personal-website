<ExpandCollapse title="Professional / Software background">
In 2019, I started a position as a Rule Developer at Transcepta LLC. This is an early-career tech role that involves programming in vbScript, Regular Expressions, and SQL, as well as some JavaScript and AutoHotKey.

While working there, I got hooked on the enjoyment of solving problems through code. I became interested in modern web development, and learned it throughout 2020 and 2021.

In 2022 my learning has picked up a great deal of momentum, and I am currently committed to evolving my skills in the modern JavaScript development ecosystem.
