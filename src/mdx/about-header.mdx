### <u>Professional / Software Background</u>

In April 2019, I got a job as a Rule Developer at a company called Transcepta.  I was interested in programming, but was new to it, and got the job through a personal connection.

The programming tasks I partook in weren't especially complex, with it being an early-career role, but it was enough for me to get off the ground and get hooked on problem-solving through code.

While working this job, I started learning modern web development in my free time.  I learned JavaScript, React, and Node, and found working in this ecosystem to be very engaging and rewarding.

My learning picked up a lot of steam in 2022, with the help of some developer friends and communities.  Currently I'm having lots of fun building personal projects and contributing to open source, and I am targeting a position as part of a modern development team.
