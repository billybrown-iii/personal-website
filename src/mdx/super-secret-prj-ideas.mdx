# Super Secret Project Ideas

## Specific project ideas:

The first two are prompt engineering ideas - simply utilizing openAI APIs.

### 1. AI powered media recommendation engine

This would essentially be a pleasant-to-use UI wrapped around the process of going to chatGPT and saying “I like X Y and Z, now recommend me stuff!”  From personal experience, I can say this works quite well to discover things I'd enjoy.

The setup view would have tabs for shows, films, games, and books.  You add your favorite things there.

The discover view would be your recommendations.  It could also have tabs for the media categories.  

You could consider adding more rich functionality incrementally.  For example:
- Rate your favorites on the strength of your affinity for it.  Some of my favorite things are weightier than others.  (i.e. the things I'm obsessed with, or that I consider to be *peak\* content, deserve extra weight)
- In your recommendations queue, an X to exclude it from recommendations.
- A prompt box to elaborate and tell the AI what sort of qualities you’re looking for.

### 2. AI feed curator

This would be a means of cleaning up your social media feeds to make them more aligned with your premeditated preferences.
For example, I might want to follow my favorite artists on twitter, but I might want to hide political or controversial content.
The AI would take your stated preferences into account, evaluate content, and filter out the stuff you’d rather not see.

### 3. Note-taking specifically for active externalism, or things you want to remember

UX:
- Open it, and see a blank screen with a text input at the bottom.
- Type something and hit enter.
- The app does cute animations, puts the thing in the center of the screen, so you can really stare at it and let it sink in.
- You can pin stuff.  It shuffles your pins and displays them on the homepage when you open the app.

### 4. An app that makes it more fun to share a thing with a friend

I'm picturing a magic link generator that makes sharing content with your friend a little more engaging.

For example, suppose I sent you a magic link that recommends you a YT video.  The magic link would include a star rating button, ability to leave comments at timestamps of the vid, easy ability to mention what parts of the video you liked or what aspects you liked/disliked, etc.

Maybe these elements could be integrated into the preview widget that appears when you share a link via Discord.

## Themes or problem spaces I’m interested in brainstorming projects for:

### 1. Coalescing people together based on tags.
So this is a topic I’ve been kicking around in my head for a long time, but as it pertains to the VtM hobby, one idea is that a product could help people form into VtM groups.  

Possible UX:
You add your discord name, time zone, and status of “looking for a group”
The product somehow facilitates you finding a group, maybe by spinning up discord servers based on categorical clusters.

I have some wider ideas around this theme, including coalescing people based on an uncommon overlap of interests, and coalescing within a metro area.
A big challenge to this idea is the marketing / network effects aspect.  (i.e., it could be challenging to get it off the ground)

### 2. Quest logging:

This would be an attempt to take real life goals, and make them feel videogamish.  This isn’t a new idea (i.e. Habitica is a thing), but my idea would be to take inspiration from games like The Elder Scrolls and guide the user through the following process:
- Identify a big goal.  (Main quest)
- Identify subquests, like actionable breadcrumbs, that will help you make progress on the main quest.
- Build a cozy looking “quest log” UI that makes it feel satisfying to log your progress on your subquests.

### 3. Making it fun to share things with friends

This directly relates to project idea #4 above - but I'd like to brainstorm other approaches too.

Listening to music, especially, is such a solitary activity.  It'd be nice if I could find ways to more enjoyably share things like songs with my friends.
