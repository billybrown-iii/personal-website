## What I'm up to now

### Software

Working on my Bonsai Notes project. Learning TypeScript (and using it in said project).

My goal is to have the entire front-end working (using local storage in the web browser). This will make it _usable_ at the very least.

Also working on this website. (You are here!)

### Hobby
